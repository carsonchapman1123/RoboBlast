# RoboBlast

This was the final project for CS32 at UCLA. I was given a 56 page document describing the game. I received 100% on the assignment. In order to run this game on Mac, one must be running XQuartz while running the code, which is available at https://www.xquartz.org/. The files I worked on were Actor.cpp, Actor.h, StudentWorld.cpp, and StudentWorld.h. The other files were provided by my professor.
